# pocketbase_google_login_flutter

Extremely rushed demo of how to integrate Google auth from Flutter with PocketBase.

The code here is very messy and only serves as a proof-of-concept. At the time of this writing the author has family obligations that do not leave much time for focused development outside his normal nine-to-five.

I may clean this up at a later time, or accept contributions if someone wants to volunteer!
